## Description/Project Goals
It's currently a WIP, but the goals are to eventually have an app, using modern Material Design guidelines and transitions/animations, that allows me to browse currently hot/"trending" patterns on Ravelry, download/view the pattern PDFs, and manage my favorites/queue/library.

I'd like to also eventually build a more robust search page, as well as support the purchasing of paid patterns.

I track progress on todo items in [TODO.md](https://github.com/kengorab/Yarnover/blob/master/TODO.md).

Also of note, is the fact that this project is built using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and makes use of many of its features, especially the `kotlinx` view extensions, and extension functions in general.
